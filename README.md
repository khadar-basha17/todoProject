I have developed a To-Do project using Spring Boot and MySQL database. 
As I am a fresher, I initially focused on mastering the backend technologies and didn't have much experience with frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.
However, I made sure to ensure that the code runs flawlessly by thoroughly testing the functionality using the Postman tool .
